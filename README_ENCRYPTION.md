# End-to-End Encryption Implementation

This application now includes **client-side end-to-end encryption** to protect user resume data. Even if someone gains access to your Firestore database, they cannot read the actual resume content without the user's authentication credentials.

## üîê How It Works

### 1. **Client-Side Encryption**

- All sensitive data is encrypted in the browser before being sent to Firestore
- Encryption keys are derived from user's Firebase Auth credentials (email + UID)
- Uses AES encryption with crypto-js library

### 2. **Selective Encryption**

Only sensitive fields are encrypted:

- Personal details (name, email, phone, etc.)
- Professional summary
- Work experience
- Skills
- Projects
- Education
- PDF files and LaTeX code

Metadata remains unencrypted for querying:

- Resume title
- Creation/update timestamps
- Template information
- Theme colors

### 3. **Backward Compatibility**

- Existing unencrypted data continues to work
- Data is gradually encrypted as users edit their resumes
- No data migration required

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install crypto-js
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file:

```env
# Your existing Firebase config
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# Generate your own encryption pepper (FREE)
VITE_ENCRYPTION_PEPPER=your-random-string-here
```

### 3. Generate Your Encryption Pepper

The encryption pepper is a **free** random string you generate yourself:

**Option 1: Online Generator**

- Visit https://randomkeygen.com/
- Copy a long "Fort Knox Password"

**Option 2: Command Line**

```bash
# Mac/Linux
openssl rand -base64 48

# Windows PowerShell
[System.Web.Security.Membership]::GeneratePassword(64, 10)
```

**Option 3: Node.js**

```javascript
console.log(require("crypto").randomBytes(32).toString("hex"));
```

**Option 4: Manual**
Just create a long random string:

```
myApp2024SecurePepper!@#xyz789RandomString$%^
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Files

- `src/utils/encryption.js` - Client-side encryption service
- `src/utils/firebase_encrypted.js` - Encrypted Firestore operations

### Updated Components

All form components now use encrypted storage:

- PersonalDetailForm
- ExperienceForm
- SummaryForm
- Skills
- Projects
- Education

### Key Features

1. **User-Specific Keys**: Each user has a unique encryption key
2. **No Server-Side Keys**: Encryption keys never leave the client
3. **Transparent Operation**: Users don't notice any difference
4. **Performance**: Minimal impact on app performance
5. **Security**: Industry-standard AES encryption

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Benefits

### Before Encryption

```json
{
  "personalDetail": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890"
  }
}
```

### After Encryption

```json
{
  "personalDetail": {
    "encrypted": "U2FsdGVkX1+vupppZksvRf5pq5g5XjFRIipRkwB0K1Y96Qsv2Lm+31cmzaAILwyt...",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "isEncrypted": true,
  "encryptionVersion": "1.0"
}
```

### What's Protected

‚úÖ **Encrypted**: Personal info, experience, skills, projects, education, PDFs
‚ùå **Not Encrypted**: Resume title, dates, template info (for search/filtering)

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

### Automatic Migration

- Existing resumes work without changes
- Data encrypts automatically when users edit
- No manual migration required

### Testing

1. Create a new resume - should be encrypted
2. Edit an old resume - should encrypt on save
3. View existing resumes - should work normally

## üö® Important Notes

### Security

- **Keep your `.env` file secret** - don't commit to Git
- **Don't lose your encryption pepper** - changing it makes old data unreadable
- **Use HTTPS** - ensure your app is served over HTTPS

### Backup

- Consider backing up your encryption pepper securely
- Database admins cannot recover data without user credentials

### Performance

- Minimal performance impact
- Encryption happens in browser (no server load)
- File sizes increase slightly due to encryption overhead

## üîç Monitoring

### Console Logs

Watch for these messages:

- ‚úÖ "Encrypted resume data saved successfully"
- ‚úÖ "Resume data decrypted successfully"
- ‚ùå "Error saving encrypted resume"

### Debugging

If you see decryption errors:

1. Check if user is properly authenticated
2. Verify encryption pepper hasn't changed
3. Ensure crypto-js is installed

## üìà Benefits

1. **Data Privacy**: Resume content is unreadable in database
2. **Compliance**: Helps meet data protection requirements
3. **User Trust**: Users know their data is secure
4. **Zero Cost**: Uses free client-side encryption
5. **Easy Setup**: Minimal configuration required

Your users' resume data is now protected with industry-standard encryption! üîê

# Encryption

This document explains how the encryption is implemented in this application.

## Key Generation

The encryption key is generated using the user's email and UID. The `generateUserKey` function in `src/utils/encryption.js` is responsible for this. It uses the `PBKDF2` algorithm to derive a secure key from the user's credentials.

## Encryption and Decryption

The `encryptData` and `decryptData` functions in `src/utils/encryption.js` are used to encrypt and decrypt the data. They use the `AES` algorithm for encryption.

## Encrypted Fields

The `SENSITIVE_FIELDS` constant in `src/utils/constants.js` defines which fields of the resume data are encrypted. Any field added to this array will be automatically encrypted when the data is saved to Firestore.

## Firebase Service

The `EncryptedFirebaseService` in `src/utils/firebase_encrypted.js` is a wrapper around the Firebase SDK that handles the encryption and decryption of data when communicating with Firestore. It uses the `SENSITIVE_FIELDS` constant to determine which fields to encrypt.
